# Muse-Project
This is a project for a Computer Engineering class.
The site id fully accessible except the YouTube video, where the checker complains about defining the size of the video in HTML and not CSS. I tried to move the size declaration to CSS, but it doesn't work. The thing that I did is that I declared the width and height of the video to be 100% in the html file, and then in css file I declared the size of the div that surrounds the video.
